            <p><i>3bitstudio</i> is run with love by three Le Wagon Alumni. We evolved out of Team Kitty, a facebook chat-bot which tracks shared expenses. Now we've turned our hand to building websites, mobile apps, you name it, we build it!

            <p> We're just getting started, but please do look at our team and our previous work.
